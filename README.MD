# Ransomware Notes and Extensions

#### This repository contains a comprehensive collection of filenames and file extensions commonly associated with ransomware infections. These lists are intended for use in detection, research, and incident response.

#### 

# Overview

#### Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files on a victim's system and demands payment for decryption. Attackers typically leave behind ransom notes and change file extensions to signal that files have been encrypted. This repository catalogs:

#### 

#### Ransom note filenames: Patterns and names used by ransomware to leave instructions or threats.

#### 

#### Ransomware file extensions: Extensions appended to encrypted files.



# Usage

#### Detection: Integrate these patterns into security tools (SIEM, EDR, AV) to detect ransomware artifacts.

#### 

#### Research: Use as a reference for identifying ransomware families and campaigns.

#### 

#### Incident Response: Quickly triage affected systems by searching for these filenames and extensions.
